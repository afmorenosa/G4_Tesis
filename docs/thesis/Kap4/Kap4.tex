\chapter{Discussion and Conclusions}

The distribution of the particle creation for both scintillator and electrons
in the two materials do not show significant difference between the three
primary particles. The only minor noticeable differences are in the standard
deviation of in the X-Y plane for neutral pion events and in the main value of
the Z-axis distributions, as commented before.

As mentioned above, the number of particles in the scintillator plates per
event is in average lower than in the lead plates, which is unexpected because
scintillator should work as an active material, i.e., produce the major amount
of particles, meanwhile lead is meant to be the absorbent
material\cite{omelaenko2000lhcb}. This issue could be due to unconsidered
material configurations in the Geant4 simulations such as optic settings, that
should increase the number of photons created inside the material.

Some classifiers do not show good performance in the differentiation task,
specially the linear classifiers. It could be due to the amount of variables
that are considered in the input, the low discrepancy between theirs
distributions and the no linearity between them. The best separation was found
for BernoulliNB.
